# Task 14 – Model Comparison & Best Model Selection

## Objective
To compare multiple machine learning models on the same dataset and select the best performing model based on evaluation metrics.

## Dataset
Breast Cancer dataset (sklearn)

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and preprocessed the dataset
2. Used the same train-test split for all models
3. Trained multiple ML models
4. Evaluated models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
5. Created a comparison table
6. Plotted performance comparison
7. Selected best model based on F1-score and generalization
8. Saved the best model

## Deliverables
- Model comparison table (`model_comparison_results.csv`)
- Performance comparison plot (`model_comparison_plot.png`)
- Best saved model (`best_model.pkl`)

## Outcome
This task demonstrates practical model selection skills used in real-world machine learning projects.
